## PROJECT CONTEXT

I'm continuing development on the **Omnia** project, a modern plugin-based application built with React, TypeScript, and Electron. We've made significant progress in our current development session.

### CURRENT STATUS
- **Branch:** feature/settings-management-architecture
- **Build Status:** ✅ Stable, no TypeScript errors
- **Runtime Status:** ✅ All major systems working
- **Phase:** Major UI/UX improvements completed

### RECENTLY COMPLETED (ALL DONE ✅)
1. **Fixed Settings System** - Resolved "process is not defined" error
2. **Fixed Demo Settings** - Settings page now loads properly
3. **Fixed Navigation** - Logs page navigation consistency
4. **Header Cleanup** - Removed redundant Omnia logo
5. **Dashboard Enhancement** - Blue background with contrasting text
6. **Status Navigation** - Clickable status squares with filtering
7. **Card Optimization** - Removed redundant active indicators
8. **Scrollbar Fix** - Fixed scrollbar hidden by status bar
9. **Plugin Grid** - Unified card layout across Dashboard and Plugins pages
10. **Control Layout** - Spread out control buttons on Plugins page
11. **iOS Toggle Switch** - NEW component replacing activate/deactivate buttons
12. **CLIENT-SIDE LOGGING** - Complete console capture system (MAJOR)
13. **SCRIPTRUNNER FIX** - Fixed fs.stat errors with proper IPC (MAJOR)
14. **LOG SYSTEM** - Enhanced parsing and level detection (MAJOR)

### KEY NEW COMPONENTS
- **ToggleSwitch Component** - `src/ui/components/ToggleSwitch/`
  - iOS-style toggle with smooth animations
  - CSS modules for complex state management
  - Full TypeScript support

### MAJOR TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS
- **Client-Side Logging** - `src/ui/client-logger.ts`
  - Captures all browser console output
  - Unified with main process logs in `logs/app.log`
  - Tagged as `[client-renderer]` vs `[electron-main]`

- **Enhanced IPC System** - `src/electron-main.ts`, `src/preload.js`
  - Added fs-stat support for plugin file operations
  - Fixed ScriptRunner plugin fs.stat errors
  - Proper security and error handling

- **Unified Log Viewer** - `src/ui/views/LogsView.tsx`
  - Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
  - Proper ERROR/WARNING level detection
  - Syntax highlighting for log levels

### REMAINING TASKS (Low Priority)
- Rename "Plugin Management" to "Plugin Settings" in navigation
- Add individual plugin settings under Plugin Settings section

### DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES NOW AVAILABLE
- **Enhanced Debugging** - Comprehensive logging system for troubleshooting
- **Stable Plugin System** - File operations work correctly via IPC
- **Solid UI Foundation** - Modern component library with iOS-style elements
- **Build System** - Complete asset processing including new components
