- **üõ†Ô∏è Reusable component library** for future applications

## Current Todo Items (Prioritized)

### **Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)**

#### 1. **Schema System** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Create Zod schemas for app configuration
- [x] Create Zod schemas for plugin manifests  
- [x] Create Zod schemas for plugin configurations

## **Parallel Work Opportunities**

These can be worked on simultaneously:
- **Settings Architecture** + **Styling Setup** (no dependencies between them)
- **Component Documentation** while building **Design System Components**
- **Testing Setup** while implementing **UI Library Structure**

## **Success Criteria**

### **Phase 1 Complete When:**
- [ ] Hybrid configuration system loads and validates all configs with Zod
- [ ] Plugin permission system prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Tailwind + CSS Modules hybrid styling works in build
- [ ] Design tokens and styling patterns are documented

### **Phase 2 Complete When:**
- [ ] Unus-inspired sidebar navigation is functional
- [ ] Plugin service registry enables inter-plugin communication
- [ ] Three-tier plugin architecture supports all plugin types
- [ ] Core components work with hybrid styling approach

### **Phase 3 Complete When:**
- [ ] Settings forms auto-generate from Zod schemas
- [ ] Existing plugins work with new architecture
- [ ] Plugin communication through service registry is validated
- [ ] Component library is organized for reuse in future applications

## **Risk Mitigation**

**High Risk Items:**
1. **Plugin Service Registry** - Complex inter-plugin communication system
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple service examples, build complexity gradually
2. **Permission System** - Balancing safety with functionality
   - *Mitigation*: Implement basic permissions first, enhance based on real usage
3. **Schema-Form Integration** - Auto-generating complex forms from Zod schemas
   - *Mitigation*: Build incrementally, test with simple schemas first

**Medium Risk Items:**
1. **Hybrid Styling** - Tailwind + CSS Modules integration and consistency
   - *Mitigation*: Document clear patterns, test with core components first
2. **Three-Tier Plugin Architecture** - Complexity of supporting multiple plugin types
   - *Mitigation*: Implement tiers incrementally, validate with existing plugins
3. **Component Reusability** - Making components work across future applications
   - *Mitigation*: Define clear component API contracts and design tokens early

## **Next Action**

**Immediate Next Step**: Begin implementing **Settings Management Architecture**
- Design hybrid configuration file structure (app.json5, plugins.json5, plugins/*.json5)
- Create configuration manager with Zod validation and error handling
- Implement plugin permission system for safety
- Add config loading/saving with schema validation

This forms the foundation that the entire new architecture will build upon.

## **Key Architectural Decisions Implemented**

Refer to [DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](./DESIGN_DECISIONS.md) for complete rationale, but key decisions include:

- **Zod schemas** for type-safe configuration with runtime validation
- **Hybrid styling** combining Tailwind CSS utilities with CSS Modules for complex components
- **Service registry pattern** for safe plugin-to-plugin communication
- **Three-tier plugin architecture** supporting simple to advanced plugin development
- **Unus-inspired UI** with sidebar navigation and single-plugin focus
- **Reusable component library** designed for use in future applications

These decisions prioritize developer experience, safety, and long-term maintainability while building a solid foundation for plugin-based application development.
