# Plugin Security Architecture

This document outlines the security model and permission system for Omnia's plugin architecture.

## 🛡 Security Overview

The plugin security system is built on the principle of least privilege, ensuring plugins can only access the resources they explicitly need and are granted permission to use.

## 🔒 Permission System

### Permission Types
- **ui:read** - Read access to UI state and display data
- **ui:write** - Ability to modify UI components and state
- **ui:notify** - Show notifications to users
- **data:read** - Read access to user data
- **data:write** - Modify user data
- **log:write** - Write to application logs
- **service:call** - Call other plugin services
- **file:read** - Read file system access
- **file:write** - Write file system access
- **network:fetch** - Make network requests

### Manifest-Based Permissions
Each plugin must declare required permissions in its `plugin.json5` manifest:

```json5
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "permissions": [
    "ui:read",
    "ui:write", 
    "data:read",
    "log:write"
  ],
  "services": {
    "provides": ["data-processor"],
    "requires": ["logger", "notifications"]
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Runtime Permission Validation

### Service Registry Enforcement
All service calls are validated against declared permissions:

```typescript
const validateServiceAccess = (
  pluginId: string,
  serviceName: string, 
  requiredPermissions: string[]
): boolean => {
  const plugin = getPluginManifest(pluginId);
  
  return requiredPermissions.every(permission =>
    plugin.permissions.includes(permission)
  );
};
```

### Permission Boundaries
- Plugins cannot escalate privileges at runtime
- All inter-plugin communication goes through service registry
- No direct file system or network access without permissions
- UI modifications are sandboxed to plugin boundaries

## 🚨 Security Vulnerabilities to Prevent

### 1. Privilege Escalation
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE: Plugin trying to access unauthorized service
const unauthorizedService = useService('admin-service', ['admin:write']);
// This should be blocked by permission validation

// ✅ SECURE: Plugin requesting only declared permissions
const logService = useService('logger', ['log:write']);
```

### 2. Data Leakage
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE: Sharing user data between plugins without permission
const shareUserData = (targetPlugin: string, userData: any) => {
  // This should be prevented by service registry
};

// ✅ SECURE: Mediated data sharing through service registry
const shareData = useService('data-sharing', ['data:share']);
```

### 3. Resource Abuse
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE: Unlimited resource consumption
while (true) {
  heavyOperation();
}

// ✅ SECURE: Resource limits and monitoring
const rateLimitedService = useService('heavy-processor', ['compute'], {
  rateLimit: { calls: 100, window: 60000 }
});
```

## 🧪 Security Testing

### Permission Testing
```typescript
describe('Plugin Security', () => {
  it('should deny access to undeclared permissions', () => {
    const plugin = loadPlugin('test-plugin', {
      permissions: ['ui:read'] // Only UI read permission
    });
    
    const logger = plugin.getService('logger', ['log:write']);
    expect(logger).toBeNull(); // Should be denied
  });
  
  it('should allow access to declared permissions', () => {
    const plugin = loadPlugin('test-plugin', {
      permissions: ['ui:read', 'log:write']
    });
    
    const logger = plugin.getService('logger', ['log:write']);
    expect(logger).toBeDefined(); // Should be allowed
  });
});
```

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Plugin Development
- [ ] Declare minimum necessary permissions in manifest
- [ ] Handle permission denied scenarios gracefully
- [ ] Never attempt to bypass permission system
- [ ] Validate all external inputs
- [ ] Use secure communication patterns

### Plugin Review
- [ ] Review requested permissions for necessity
- [ ] Check for potential privilege escalation
- [ ] Verify secure data handling
- [ ] Test permission boundary enforcement
- [ ] Audit external dependencies
