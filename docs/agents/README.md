# Agent System Documentation

This folder contains documentation for Omnia's multi-agent development system, designed to solve complex problems through systematic analysis and coordinated execution.

## Agent System Overview

The agent system provides a structured approach to complex problem-solving through specialized agents that work together:

1. **PLANNER**: Root cause analysis and solution planning
2. **COORDINATOR**: Task coordination and execution management
3. **DOCUMENTER**: Documentation and knowledge capture
4. **PROJECT_MANAGER**: Project oversight and progress tracking
5. **TESTER**: Quality assurance and validation

## Documents

### Agent Definitions
- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** - Overview of the agent system
- **[PLANNER.md](./PLANNER.md)** - Problem analysis and planning agent
- **[COORDINATOR.md](./COORDINATOR.md)** - Task coordination and execution
- **[DOCUMENTER.md](./DOCUMENTER.md)** - Documentation and knowledge management
- **[PROJECT_MANAGER.md](./PROJECT_MANAGER.md)** - Project oversight and tracking
- **[TESTER.md](./TESTER.md)** - Quality assurance and testing

## How to Use the Agent System

### 1. Problem Analysis (PLANNER Phase)
When facing a complex problem:

```
1. Read existing documentation (GUIDE.md, LEARNINGS.md)
2. Perform root cause analysis
3. Create WORK.md file with detailed plan
4. Reference existing patterns and solutions
```

### 2. Coordination (COORDINATOR Phase)
After planning:

```
1. Parse PLANNER output into executable steps
2. Manage task dependencies and execution order
3. Handle resource conflicts and bottlenecks
4. Monitor progress and adjust as needed
```

### 3. Execution Phases
Follow systematic approach:

```
1. Execute tasks in planned order
2. Document learnings and patterns
3. Update knowledge base
4. Validate results through testing
```

## Agent Workflows

### Standard Problem-Solving Flow
```
Problem → PLANNER → COORDINATOR → Execution → DOCUMENTER → TESTER
```

### Iterative Development Flow
```
Requirements → PLANNER → PROJECT_MANAGER → COORDINATOR → Implementation → TESTER → Review
```

### Emergency Response Flow
```
Critical Issue → PLANNER (rapid analysis) → COORDINATOR (immediate action) → DOCUMENTER (capture fix)
```

### Knowledge Management
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify reusable solutions
2. **Learning Capture**: Document new insights
3. **Best Practices**: Maintain development standards
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Make information accessible

## Examples

### Example 1: Plugin System Enhancement
```
1. PLANNER: Analyze current plugin architecture, identify limitations
2. COORDINATOR: Plan migration strategy, coordinate with existing plugins
3. DOCUMENTER: Update architecture documentation, create migration guide
4. TESTER: Validate plugin compatibility, test performance impact
```

### Example 2: Performance Optimization
```
1. PLANNER: Profile application, identify bottlenecks
2. COORDINATOR: Prioritize optimizations, plan implementation
3. Implementation: Execute optimizations in planned order
4. TESTER: Validate performance improvements, ensure no regressions
5. DOCUMENTER: Document optimization techniques and results
```

### Example 3: Bug Investigation
```
1. PLANNER: Analyze bug reports, identify root cause
2. COORDINATOR: Plan fix implementation, coordinate testing
3. Implementation: Implement fix following plan
4. TESTER: Validate fix, ensure no side effects
5. DOCUMENTER: Document fix and prevention strategies
```
