# Omnia
This will be an evolution of the ttComander application

The project runs entirely in a standard Node environment using an Express server.

## Contributing

- Follow Test-Driven Development for all changes.
- When adding a new feature:
  1. Write a failing test that demonstrates the desired behavior and commit it.
  2. Implement the code required to make the test pass and commit that change separately.
- Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass before pushing.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start the app in development mode using `npm run dev`.
3. Build the project with `npm run build`.
4. Run the compiled app using `npm start` which launches the Express server and opens the app in your browser.
