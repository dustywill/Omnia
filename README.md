## Contributing

- Follow Test-Driven Development for all changes.
- When adding a new feature:
  1. Write a failing test that demonstrates the desired behavior and commit it.
  2. Implement the code required to make the test pass and commit that change separately.
- Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass before pushing.
