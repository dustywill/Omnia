I want to work on the script-runner plugin. Please cosult the screenshot/Other Apps/ttComander - Script Runner.jpg screen shot. You can see that there are different spaces for the things being displayed. We have a location for he scripts. Those scripts are sparatedseparated into tgroups. Those groups are configured in the Script Runner configuration. You can see how ttCommander handled the coniguration of the plugins and the script inside it if you consult the inspiration/ttcommander-config.json5 file. You can also see the schema from the ttcommander in these files inspiration/schema/app-config.schema.json5 and inspiration/schema/plugin.schema.json5  
I want you to design this UI and begin getting the configuration of individual scripts set up. Feel free to copy what I gave you or improve upon it.
