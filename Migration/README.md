# Node-ttCommander to Omnia Migration

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for merging Node-ttCommander and Omnia projects into a unified, modern application. The merge strategy uses Omnia as the foundation while preserving Node-ttCommander's proven design system and stable features.

## Migration Strategy

**Approach**: Merge toward Omnia's architecture while preserving Node-ttCommander's strengths
**Timeline**: 6-month phased migration
**Risk Level**: Medium (with comprehensive mitigation strategies)

## Key Objectives

1. **Preserve Excellence**: Maintain Node-ttCommander's outstanding design system and proven features
2. **Modernize Architecture**: Leverage Omnia's TypeScript + React foundation
3. **Ensure Compatibility**: Support existing plugins during transition
4. **Enhance Developer Experience**: Improve development tools and maintainability
